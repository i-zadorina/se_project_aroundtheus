This is the third project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, based on the Figma design.

The instructors provided us with videos assisting us in the basic structure of the project, but they provided us with no written code. We had to write all the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript ourselves. In addition, the details of the responsive design were also up to us to construct.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Positioning and Responsive design
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- Interface for Desktop and Mobile
- The DOM
- Nodes, Events and Templates in JavaScript
- OOP and Modular JavaScript
